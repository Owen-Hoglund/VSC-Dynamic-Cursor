# old-hoglie-dynamic-cursor README
This just allows the user to drop the head or tail cursor when using multiple cursors. Primarily useful when replacing multiple occurrences of a pattern. 

## Features
Drop tail Cursor: ctrl+, (<)
Drop head Cursor: ctrl+. (>)

## Known Issues
- I would like to be able to persist selection when replacing text

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0 
Seems to function as desired. Not sure if I will ever add to this as I now have the feature I wanted.
